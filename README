# String::Similex

This module was made to compare strings that can be visually equivalent,
i.e., when you look at a word on the screen you can make a visual mistake.

Some examples of this are "Gandalf" and "Ganda1f", "morning" and "mornimg"

or even cool writing "cool" and "c00l".
If you want more robust and unabridged routines please check the SEE ALSO
section on the documentation.
